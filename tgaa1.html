        <p>大逆転裁判 -成歩堂龍ノ介の冒險- (Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhodō Ryūnosuke no Bōken) was first released in
            Japan on July 9,
            2015 for the Nintendo 3DS. It was localized into English and released worldwide as "The Great Ace Attorney:
            Adventures," along with its sequel, as part of "The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles" on July 27, 2021 on PC
            and various consoles.</p>
        <p>A spinoff of the main series, it stars Phoenix Wright's ancestor, Japanese budding defence attorney Ryunosuke
            Naruhodo, as he
            solves murder
            cases in Meiji-era Japan and Victorian-era London at the turn of the 20th century. With his trusted judicial
            assistant, Susato Mikotoba, and the help of British detective Sherlock Ho- sorry, <i>Herlock Sholmes</i>,
            Ryunosuke must uncover various mysteries by defending his clients in court against ruthless prosecutor Barok
            van Zieks.</p>
        <p>Before "The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles" was released, a group known as "Scarlet Study"
            released an English
            fan translation of the first game. If you've seen English-language Youtubers play the game before 2021, it
            was most likely this version. Additionally, a YouTube channel known as "Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2" had released
            a
            walkthrough of the game in Japanese with English subtitles. Their playlist can be found <a target="_blank"

        <p>After its initial release, the game received bonus content in the form of "escapades," short
            kinetic novels
            approximately fifteen minutes each in length, some of which are told from the point of view of characters
            other than
            Ryunosuke. Eight of these escapades were released along with "The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles."</p>
